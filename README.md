# WidaTech Technical Test

## Description
This project is a full-stack application developed for the technical test at WidaTech, using React for the client-side and Node.js for the server-side. The application aims to demonstrate my skills in building responsive and functional web applications.

## Client-Side (React)
The client-side is built using React. It includes components for user interface, routing, and state management.
